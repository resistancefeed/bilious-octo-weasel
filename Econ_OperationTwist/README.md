Ben Bernanke had a press conference yesterday to extend his policy "Operation Twist".It was yesterday and I didn't have much time to learn the details of his updated
policy. 

1. Do some research and explain Operation Twist.
2. Explain the mechanism behing Operation Twist.
3. How does this decision affect people's expectations?
