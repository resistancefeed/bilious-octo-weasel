This was an assignment for a Computer Science course called Operating Systems Design. The goal was to design a kernal based off of the given skeleton (vmemraid_GIVEN_skeleton.c) and header files that created a virtual array of 4 disks to be used in a RAID 4 configuration. My submission is called vmemraid_main_josh.c. 

I was one of two students in the entire class to receive a 100%. The class average for this assignment was a 40%. 

It is further described in the RAID4-assignment#4.pdf and information on using the supplied vm are in the other pdf.
